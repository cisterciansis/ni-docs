`Bittensor is revolutionizing the development of machine learning platforms by decentralizing the process and creating a peer-to-peer market for machine intelligence. It enables the collective intelligence of AI models to come together, forming a digital hive mind. This decentralized approach allows for the rapid expansion and sharing of knowledge, akin to an unstoppable library of knowledge that grows exponentially. By harnessing the power of distributed networks and incentivizing collaboration, Bittensor is driving innovation and pushing the boundaries of machine learning. -`[`bittensor.org`](https://bittensor.org/)

## What is Bittensor?

### Permission-less P2P digital commodity market.

Started as an open-source machine learning protocol, Bittensor has expanded into a decentralized commodity market incentivized with a unified digital asset, $TAO. These commodity markets called subnetworks all interact and integrate into a single computing infrastructure on Bittensor’s blockchain.

This framework enables the building of a hierarchical web of distributed resources, which ultimately leads to the creation of machine intelligence. Bittensor’s unique incentivization mechanism encourages continual development, improvement, and participation. This leads to a self-sustaining and progressively advancing supercomputer with a vast amount of resources from intelligence to compute.

As a permission-less and incentivized network, Bittensor is poised to become the largest and most intelligent neural network in the world, redefining machine intelligence as a key commodity of the 21st century. Machine intelligence should be a shared asset, aligning with the collective interests of humanity. Bittensor symbolizes this future of unbiased, uncensored, and democratized AI where intelligence is a tool of collective empowerment rather than a control mechanism of the select few.

**Decentralized Commodity Markets**: Bittensor functions as a language to create numerous decentralized markets, called 'subnets', under a unified token system. These markets operate through Bittensor's blockchain, allowing for interaction and integration into a single computing infrastructure, similar to how Ethereum expanded on Bitcoin's concept to support decentralized contracts​​.

**Framework for Intelligence Creation**: The framework Bittensor offers enables the building of a hierarchical web of resources, which ultimately leads to the creation of intelligence. This intelligence leverages computation, data, and storage within the ecosystem. Bittensor's vision is to harness digital markets for the benefit of Artificial Intelligence, ensuring that the benefits and ownership of machine intelligence are accessible to a broader audience​​.

**Benefits for Various Stakeholders**: For developers, Bittensor offers a platform to create markets for bespoke commodities like computational power, exploiting the vast scale and efficiency of decentralized systems. Consumers get access to resources at lower costs without intermediaries. Bittensor as a whole aims to create Machine Intelligence in an open and equitable manner on top of these sub-markets​​.

**Operational Dynamics**: Bittensor's computational power is abstracted underneath its markets. It leverages machine learning models and physical storage to create diverse products, without defining the specifics of resource production. This abstraction allows for innovation and problem-solving by numerous individuals globally​​.

**Similarities and Differences with Bitcoin**: Bittensor, like Bitcoin, has a transferable, censorship-resistant token (TAO) and is run by miners. However, unlike Bitcoin, which focuses on token economics and resistance to external influences, Bittensor's primary goal is to build markets that create value. This involves incentivizing its compute network to grow significantly, with miners working to reduce costs and create digital intelligence products.

## Yuma Consensus

The Yuma Consensus is an innovative consensus mechanism developed by the Bittensor Network. It's a decentralized, peer-to-peer algorithm that facilitates the distribution of computational resources across a network of nodes. This mechanism is revolutionary for AI development because it creates a decentralized AI network free from central or single-entity control, enhancing efficiency, robustness, and security.

Key features include:

* **Decentralized Distribution of Computational Resources**: It enables the distribution of computational resources across a network of miners and validators, facilitating complex tasks and larger datasets, and scaling as more participants join.
* **Hybrid Proof-of-Work and Proof-of-Stake Mechanisms**: Miners perform computational work to validate transactions and create blocks, rewarded with tokens. Validators, holding $TAO, verify this work and participate in the consensus process, aligning their actions with the network's best interests.
* **Support for Decentralized AI Applications:** The Yuma Consensus allows decentralized AI applications to run across a network of miners and validators, enhancing scalability and security, and reducing single points of failure.
* **Scalability:** The decentralized nature allows easy network expansion as more participants join, suitable for handling larger AI workloads.
* **Flexibility and Customization**: The network's decentralized structure allows customization for various organizational and application needs, prioritizing miners based on computational power or validation level.
* **Robustness and Resilience Against Censorship**: Designed for robustness, the consensus is designed to support unstoppable AI applications, free from censorship or interference by central authorities
* **Balancing Energy Consumption and Centralization**: This hybrid mechanism addresses the energy consumption of proof-of-work and centralization risks of proof-of-stake, maintaining a secure, decentralized network.

At the heart of Bittensor is the Yuma consensus mechanism, allowing for the permissionless creation of subnets and consensus models. This flexibility empowers the community to determine what is necessary and valuable, leading to a network that is both dynamic, responsive, and ever-evolving.

### Subnetworks

"Subnets compartmentalize different components of the Bittensor network, enabling a new approach to incentivizing and governing AI advancements. Each subnet allows developers to design custom incentive systems tailored to the specific needs of each AI component" - tensorspace.io

## Intelligence as a Commodity

The creation of digital trust, also known as Bitcoin, demonstrated how computing can be organized using a protocol to produce something superior to anything that can be achieved by a centralized organization.

Bittensor utilizes digital trust to establish markets for AI, resulting in the creation of the first cognitive economy. This economy prices and enables the exchange of pure machine intelligence between consumers and producers, forming the first neural internet that enables researchers to connect directly and encourages collaboration to produce a more advanced intelligence source for the web.

*"We're doing something similar to Bitcoin at Bittensor, where there is consensus around who is creating value & we can distribute tokens to those computers...*

*Thus, creating a competitive & incentivized mechanism for the creation of machine intelligence" -* **Opentensor Foundation**

## The Future of AI is Decentralized

"The future of AI should be decentralized, full stop. We need to treat the knowledge created by AI as the ultimate commodity, the equivalent of a cognitive process in the human mind. Collaborating together to increase the breadth and depth of this knowledge is not only our calling as scientists, but our calling as humans as well." - Bittensor Co-Founder Ala Shaabana
