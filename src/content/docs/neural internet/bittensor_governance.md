title: "Bittensor Governance"
---

With Bittensor's DAO going Live there are now twelve senate slots that hold collective veto power on sudo calls made by a group of three Opentensor Foundation members, known as the triumvirate. Neural Inτerneτ holds one of these twelve slots and is now part of the senate.

The responsibility of the senate is to optimize distributed consensus and ensure fair & effective decision-making in the Bittensor ecosystem.
